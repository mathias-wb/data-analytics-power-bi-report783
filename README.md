## Overview
This repository contains the files and documentation for my Power BI Data Analysis project, showcasing my skills in data visualization and analysis. The project focuses on transforming data into actionable insights for better decision-making by using Microsoft Power BI to design a comprehensive Quarterly report.

## Key Features
This project will involve:
- Extracting and transforming data from various origins
- Designing a robust data model rooted in a star-based schema
- Constructing a multi-page report

The report will present a high-level business summary tailored for C-suite executives, and also give insights into their highest value customers segmented by sales region, provide a detailed analysis of top-performing products categorised by type against their sales targets, and a visually appealing map visual that spotlights the performance metrics of their retail outlets across different territories.
